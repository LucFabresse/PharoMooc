TOOLS USED:
Spotter

CODE USED:
Point

SCRIPT:
Let's see how to browse the code of a class using the Spotter. The Spotter can
be found in Pharo by hitting Shift-Enter.

Point > Enter

Now if we write Point again, the Spotter will show us the History of searches
as well as other classes that have the "Point" in their name.

This allows you to access the last visited class extremely quickly.
