SCRIPT:
Visual tips to simplify your the feedback you get from what you are coding.
If we write a capitalised "C", it will be in italic because there are
existing classes in the system that start like this.
Now, if we write "Color", the word will come back to normal and be emphasised.
Writing "Colox" will make the word become red, showing this is not recognised
by the system (no class start with this prefix).
Same thing for the methods.
