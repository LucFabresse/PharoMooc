Difference between DO IT and PRINT IT. Next we will look at INSPECT IT and DO IT
AND GO.
DO IT (CMD-D)        -> Executing the expression without necessarily displaying the
                        result
                     -> Workspace open
PRINT IT (CMD-P)     -> Shows the textual representation
INSPECT IT (CMD-I)   -> Opens an inspector on the result, it allows to inspect
                        the object we just created.
DO IT AND GO (CMD-G) -> Executes and opens an inspector but opens it within
                        the same window. Navigation windows operations.
