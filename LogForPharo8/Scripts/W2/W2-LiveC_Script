SCRIPT:
We will look at the class browser in this video. The code browser is, as its name
might tell you, the tool you use to navigate the code. On the left you will have
all the packages imported and composing the Pharo environment.

Let's look at a package -> Color.
We can see inheritance in the indentation of the class names.
Clicking on a class will display its contents.
We can look at the comment of the class.

The next column corresponds to the protocols, the conceptual groups of methods.
When you define a method you can assign it to a protocol. For example, going
into accessing will display the different accessors of the class on the right.
The column on the right corresponds to the method, clicking on a method name
will display its body under the columns.
