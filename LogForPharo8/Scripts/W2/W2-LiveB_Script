SCRIPT:
We will look closely at a tool called the Inspector in this video. The inspector
acts as a microscope as it can observe the behaviour of any Pharo object. As the
system itself is composed of Pharo objects, the Inspector can be used on any
component of Pharo. Moreover, it can interact with the objects it is observing.

We are now a biologist that is observing a cell culture and can interact with
them with a scalpel.

The expression I have just prepared is exotic:

OrderedDictionary new
  at: 'Time' put: Time now;
  at: 'Date' put: Date today;
  at: 'Morph' put: HSVAColorSelectorMorph new;
  yourself

You should not see it in a real system but it is really nice for demo purposes.
-> Select and Inspect it.

The inspector shows the items of the collection
-> By clicking on an item another inspector will open on that particular
   item.

This inspector offers a number of different views that will adapt to the object
we are observing.

-> RAW: shows the implementation
    |-> Open a browser on the class OrderedDictionary
    |-> Show the instance variables (dictionary orderedKeys)
    |-> The inspector shows the raw values contained within the instance variables
        |-> Clicking on dictionary shows the raw view of the dictionary
        |-> Clicking on orderedKeys shows the raw view of the table

-> ITEMS: view offered by OrderedDictionary to visualise best its contents (no
          need to look into the whole raw information)
   |-> DO IT MANUALLY within the raw tab dictionary > 6 > association > etc.
       The inspector will display a navigation helper with dots
       |-> Show preview
       |-> Rearrange the views or change focus and size
   |-> Date, key and value "self browse" (look at the instance variables, those
       can be found in the inspector as well).
        |-> Date > details brings another view (year, month, etc.)
        |-> Each object can decide on how it can be shown in an inspector (another video)
        |-> Calendar here
   |-> Same thing with Time
        |-> Meta tab that shows the different methods (self hour > do it > find it in meta)
   |-> With Morph, it looks like a way more complex object as it has several tabs
        |-> Clicking on the morph tab will show how it is displayed
        |-> self openInWorld > you can then interact with the object
        |-> self selectedColor
              |-> Doing Inspect It on this object will open an inspector on a color
              |-> BUT doing Do It and Go will inject the result in the flow of the
                  inspector
        |-> Submorphs tab

-> On the Morph item, open two times the same view on the same object
    |-> Opening Morph on the right and letting the tree on the left will update
        the morph on the right as soon as you are pressing on a submorph on the left
    |-> This makes it really easy to access submorph that would otherwise be hidden
        in the tree in RAW mode.
    |-> This type of manipulation can be done on several types of objects such
        as file system or classes themselves.

Inspector can observe, talk and interact with the objects as you can change them
on the fly. Any object can give different aspects and views to the inspector to
display.
