CODE USED:
OrderedCollection browse.

SCRIPT:
The class OrderedCollection is defined in the package Collections-Sequenceable.
This package holds a lot of very important objects in the system such as Array,
Interval, LinkedList and OrderedCollection.

We can see that OrderedCollection is a subclass of SequenceableCollection. Now
one thing that we might appreciate is to be able to navigate through the superclass
to see which methods are overridden for example.
In order to do that, click on Inheritance. Here we can see the class hierarchy.
The classes whose name is in black are defined within the package but the ones
in grey are defined outside of the package.

Clicking back on the Hierarchy button while being in a grey class (Sequenceable collection)
(outside of the initial package) will redirect you to the other package.

Clicking back on Hierarchy will show you Collection will centre it around
SequenceableCollection. We can now look back for our OrderedCollection, reclick
on Hierarchy to get back to the initial package.

The system browser will help you navigate in both packages or hierarchy without
taking packages in account.
