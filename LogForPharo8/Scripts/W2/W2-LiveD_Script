SCRIPT:
Different packages exist with triangles. A package defined this way has different
tags that you can explore. This is very useful on large packages as it helps
you filter the information quickly.

You can filter the packages by name
"Collection"       -> All packages containing Collection in their name or tags
"Collection|Morph" -> All packages containing Morph and Collection

The last thing you can do is create a scope to narrow down the packages that you want
to see. This will allow you to ignore the already defined packages that Pharo
exposes and lets you focus on the ones you need.
