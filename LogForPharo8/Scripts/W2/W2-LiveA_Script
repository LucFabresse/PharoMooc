SCRIPT:
Let's look at the Finder to find some information.
-Look for a method containing "match"
  |-> Triangle > defined in multiple classes

-Look for classes containing "match"
  |-> good idea to browse them right after

-Know what you are looking for but don't know its name
-This is a perfect use of the examples tab with:
 'ab*' . 'abcd' . true
  |-> This will output all methods that return true for the two given arguments
  |-> Triangle shows all the classes that implements the method and output the result.
      The class with the * is the one that the most resemblant to the signature
      and pattern we gave

 11 . 2 . 5
  |-> * on Integer, SmallInteger or Number

 11 . 2 . 5.5
  |-> / only so it can be really specific

 #(11 22 33) . 4 . 11
  |-> Executable comment makes you both double check that your query outputted
      the correct result and gives you an insight on how to use the new method.
-Look for a particular pragma
 menu
 |-> All methods implementing this pragma (help building menu). We can see the
     class WorldMenu using it (WorldMenu is the main menu when clicking on Pharo
     background)

-Look for the string 'menu' wherever it is in the system
  |-> The system will analyse the bodies of all methods within the system
      (80 000)

Encourage you to use this tool that comes as a dynamic documentation from within
Pharo. The examples part is extremely powerful and can help you find a method by
specifying the wanted behaviour.
